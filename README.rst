The concept of aggregating government services in one place is awesome,the
thought of accessing these services online is revolutionary.

Many Kenyans hate the business name search process,so much paper work and almost
a whole day is wasted in various queues ...plus you have to pay:we have a big UX
problem to solve.

What if business name search could just be as simple as a Google web search?

I thought about this, and instead of complaining,i've cobbled up this concept
app to show what is possible,and wrote a blog post too -- see:https://medium.com/@mwaigaryan/huduma-center-a-kenyan-case-of-bad-design-6a9776654cca

The modular way in which Django apps can be plugged into a project could be
really useful for the Kenyan government in its bid to centralize all services
in a single web app.
